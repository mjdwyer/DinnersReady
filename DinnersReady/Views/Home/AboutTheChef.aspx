<center><h3>About The Chef</h3></center>

<p>My love of cooking began as a child while watching my mom rustle up our family dinners each night.
 She was always willing to let me help and when I was a teenager, I spent a summer learning family recipes and cooking tips from her. Later, I was always cooking for friends and family- experimenting with recipes and new flavors.
After relocating to the south and suffering the loss of a loved one, I turned to cooking as a way of healing for myself and my family.
    It gave me great comfort to provide something so tangibly nourishing to the people I love. I thought "I could do this for other families, too!" And so I embarked on my cooking career path.
I love my work because it gives me great pleasure 
to prepare healthful, delicious food for others. I enjoy seeing the 
positive changes my service creates in my clients’ lives.
</p>
<p>
When I cook, I do not use shortcuts. I create meals with fresh, seasonal 
ingredients according to each client’s personal taste preferences and 
dietary needs. In short, I cook for each client as though I were cooking for my own family in my own home.</p>
<p> 
It would be an honor and a privilege to cook for you. Whatever your preferences, I am eager to
customize my services to fit your specifications. I look forward to 
working with you!
