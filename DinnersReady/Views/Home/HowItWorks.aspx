<center><h3>How It Works</h3></center>

<p>We meet for a free initial assessment, where I learn about your dietary preferences and 
restrictions, as well as your eating lifestyle.</p>
<p>
You choose from a comprehensive menu. These are only samples, and I am 
happy to prepare any recipes you want.</p>
<p> 
On your cook day I buy all of the 
groceries, then come to your house and do all the cooking. In a few hours I fill your fridge and freezer with delicious, 
healthy, ready-to-serve meals, complete with user-friendly heating and serving instructions.You return home to 
the wonderful aromas of good home cooking, a full fridge – and a clean kitchen! 
Your meals are ready to serve and enjoy together.</p>
